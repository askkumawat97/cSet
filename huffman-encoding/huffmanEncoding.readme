initially a link list store the data and it transformed into binary tree(a mean heap for huffman code).

direct hashing(index is ascii value) is used to calculate frequency.

huffman encode includes string of bits, consider it as integer so it takes less space, eg. 10101101==173




problems may occurs in-
calcASCII- system dependent, sometimes MSB considered as sign bit.
